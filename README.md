### Project Overview:

- The dataset for this project is a relational set of files describing customers' orders over time. The dataset is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. For each user, we provide between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. We also provide the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders. 

### Introduction:

- This project aims to analyze user behavior and sales patterns within the Instacart app to identify potential business opportunities. By examining data related to product orders, customer interactions, and shopping habits, we aim to provide actionable insights that can help enhance the user experience and drive sales growth.

### Hypotheses and Business Opportunities üí°

**1. Promoting High-Performing Aisles**

- **Hypothesis:** Promoting products from the highest-selling aisles will boost overall sales.

- **Opportunity:** Create targeted promotions and highlight these aisles on the app‚Äôs home page.


**2. Detecting patterns in order timing:**

- **Hypothesis:** Detecting patterns of orders during the week and at which time of the day such occurs.

- **Opportunity:** Implement features on the app to increase consumer interaction during peak times.


**3. Identify Customer Loyalty**

- **Hypothesis:** Establishing loyalty levels for different types of customers and developing a program to increase customer engagement and order frequency.

- **Opportunity:** Identify features from different customer groups (clusters) and try to increase loyalty and orders.
